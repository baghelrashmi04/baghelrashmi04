### 🚀 Featured Projects

**[AI Resume ATS Analyzer](https://github.com/baghelrashmi04/ai-resume-ats-analyzer)**

End-to-end pipeline: resume upload → text extraction (pdfplumber/python-docx) → spaCy keyword matching → LLM-powered bullet rewriting (Gemini) → live ATS score. Containerized with a two-service Docker architecture, deployed live on Render.

🔗 [Live demo](https://ai-resume-ats-analyze-1.onrender.com) · Tech: FastAPI, Streamlit, spaCy, Google Gemini API, Docker

> One real problem I solved: the LLM would occasionally *fabricate* specifics for vague resume bullets instead of flagging them. Fixed by building a separate vagueness-detection layer that routes thin bullets away from the rewriter instead of letting the model guess.

**[Smart EV Grid Optimization & Predictive Demand Engine](https://github.com/baghelrashmi04/Smart-EV-grid-optmization-Demand-Engine)**

Time-series forecasting system predicting EV charging station demand 24 hours ahead, to help operators load-balance before grid congestion hits. Benchmarked Linear Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost against a naive baseline on 8K+ real charging session records.

Tech: pandas, scikit-learn, XGBoost, time-series feature engineering

> One real problem I solved: found and eliminated data leakage from a near-duplicate target column and leaky interaction features — the kind of bug that quietly inflates accuracy until it hits production.

### 🌱 Currently building

Finishing the EV project's live pipeline — feature-builder service, orchestrated scheduling (Airflow/Prefect), Docker deployment, and basic model-drift monitoring.
